## Overview

This repository has the definitions for the **EU Climate Advisory Board Scenario Explorer**
hosting emissions scenarios to support the **European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change**
in its advice relating to the EU Climate Law.

Visit https://data.ece.iiasa.ac.at/eu-climate-advisory-board for more information.

## Data submission

The **European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change** issued a call for submission
of scenario data relevant to the assessment of the remaining European greenhouse gas budget. 

See https://climate-advisory-board.europa.eu/news/call-for-scenario-data-contributions-closed
for more information.

### Variable and region definitions

The columns **region** and **variable** have to follow the codelists given in the folder 
[definitions](definitions).

## Workflow

The module `workflow.py` in this repository has a function `main(df: pyam.IamDataFrame) -> pyam.IamDataFrame:`.
It is used to validate any data submission to the Scenario Explorer against the project-specific codelists
and perform region-aggregation (optional).

## Dependencies

This repository uses the Python package **nomenclature** for scenario validation and region processing.
The nomenclature package provides a structured way to define code-lists for validation and mappings
for automated region-processing to support model comparison projects.
[Read the nomenclature docs](https://nomenclature-iamc.readthedocs.io) for more information...

The nomenclature package depends on the Python package **pyam**.
The pyam package was developed to facilitate working with timeseries
data conforming to the IAMC structure. Features include scenario processing, plotting,
algebraic computations to derive indicators, validation of values, aggregation and downscaling of data,
and import/export with various file formats (`xlsx`, `csv`, frictionless-datapackage).
